# Provisions the OpenEstate test database against a PostgreSQL server you
# already run, then applies migrations and seeds it. No containers — this
# repo has no Docker in it at all; you bring Postgres and Redis the same
# way a production install does (see docs/docs/installation.md).
#
# Usage:
#   ./scripts/test-setup.sh            # create DB + roles, migrate, seed
#   ./scripts/test-setup.sh teardown   # DROP the test database
#
# Connecting as an admin, two modes, matching deploy/native/setup-database.sh:
#   local  (default) — `sudo -u postgres psql`, Unix-socket peer auth
#   remote (TCP)     — set PGPASSWORD, and TEST_PG_HOST if not localhost
#
# Overridable:
#   TEST_PG_HOST (unset=peer auth)  TEST_PG_PORT (5432)
#   TEST_PG_ADMIN_USER (postgres)   TEST_DB_NAME (openestate_test)
#   TEST_REDIS_HOST (localhost)     TEST_REDIS_PORT (6379)

# COREPACK_ENABLE_DOWNLOAD_PROMPT=0: corepack's "Do you want to continue?
# [Y/n]" prompt (shown the first time this repo's pinned pnpm version isn't
# already cached for the invoking user) reads from stdin — real feedback on
# a real interactive terminal, but this script has no guarantee of one (an
# agent, a CI runner, anything that doesn't provide a live keyboard), so
# left at its default the prompt just hangs forever. Reproduced directly
# (a fresh COREPACK_HOME against this project's pinned pnpm@9.15.0, network
# reachable): the prompt appears and blocks indefinitely with no env var
# set; with this one set, it proceeds straight to the download instead —
# confirmed the hang is gone, not just less likely.
#
# Investigated whether the fetch itself can be avoided entirely when the
# pinned version isn't cached, rather than just making its failure mode
# clean — tried COREPACK_ENABLE_NETWORK=0 (fails cleanly instead of
# fetching, but never succeeds either — it can't use a different, already-
# installed pnpm, it just refuses) and COREPACK_ENABLE_PROJECT_SPEC=0
# (ignores this repo's pin and tries to fetch pnpm "latest" instead — worse,
# not better, and defeats the entire point of pinning). Neither lets
# corepack fall back to an already-installed different-version pnpm; there
# is no such fallback in corepack's own design short of disabling the pin
# outright, which was rejected — every contributor and CI run using the
# exact same pnpm version is worth keeping. A real download over the
# network stays possible when genuinely needed; run_pnpm() below is what
# makes THAT failing cleanly instead of hanging or dumping a raw stack
# trace.

# roles — refusing to proceed on a cluster that looked like it hosted a real
# install, because provisioning tests there reset those roles' passwords and
# broke it). Both checks existed for exactly one reason: TEST_APP_ROLE/
# TEST_SYSTEM_ROLE used to be the SAME names a real install uses
# (openestate_app/openestate_system). Now that they're structurally
# different (openestate_test_app/openestate_test_system), the harm the guard
# existed to prevent can't happen — this script never creates, alters, or
# reads the password of any role a real install uses, on any cluster,
# regardless of what else that cluster hosts. Keeping the guard around
# would mean keeping dead code whose own error messages describe a
# collision that is no longer possible; removed rather than left
# half-meaningful. TEST_ALLOW_SHARED_CLUSTER is gone with it — nothing left
# to opt into.

# Migrations CREATE ROLE ... BYPASSRLS, which only a superuser may do, so
# migrate/seed cannot run as the test app/system roles. A native
# install solves this by running them as the `postgres` OS user over the
# Unix socket (install-native.sh's run_as_superuser). That does not work
# from a developer checkout: Prisma stats its cwd for a config file first,
# and the `postgres` user usually cannot traverse a $HOME checkout — the
# EACCES failure documented in install-native.sh. So tests get their own
# superuser login role and connect over TCP as the developer instead.
