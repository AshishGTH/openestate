 *  - Permission has exactly two columns (id, key) and no company scope —
 *    there is nothing about a permission an admin could have customised,
 *    so upserting is unconditionally safe, on a fresh install or the
 *    thousandth upgrade of an old one.
 *  - Deliberately NOT extended to seeded masters, nor to the
 *    role_permissions of any role EXCEPT super_admin and portal roles
 *    (see the two functions below). Both
 *    are per-company data an admin may have already renamed, deactivated,

 *    correctness bug of its own, not a fix. A future release that adds a
 *    new default master type needs a deliberate, opt-in per-company
 *    decision, not an automatic sync here.
 *
 * Exists as its own script (seed.ts imports and calls it, not a
 * duplicate copy) because seed.ts's OWN permission-upsert loop is
 * unreachable on any install that already has a company — which is
 * every real install after its first boot — so seed.ts alone never
 * delivers a later release's new PERMISSIONS constants to an existing
 * install. See CLAUDE.md's v0.2.0 upgrade-path entry for the bug this
 * fixes: a release that adds a permission and ships a UI gated on it
 * upgrades cleanly and heals nothing — no role can be granted a

 * to respect, it's drift from its own contract.
 *
 * Found on a real v0.1.2 -> v0.2.3 upgrade: `permissions` had all 142

 * pre-existing companies still had only 140 — missing exactly the two
 * v0.2.0 added (`inventory.unit.plc-manage`/`charge-manage`). The PLC
 * pricing UI those gate was therefore unreachable for every company
 * that existed before that release, on every upgraded install, with no
 * error to explain why. Adding a permission and shipping a UI gated on
 * it silently did nothing for the most privileged role in the product.
 *
 * Every OTHER role (company_admin, sales_manager, custom roles) is
 * still deliberately untouched — those are genuine composition choices
 * an admin may have narrowed, and an upgrade must not widen them. An
