# Read-only report: interest accrued against installments whose label
# suggests a construction/handover stage (Excavation, Plinth,
# Superstructure, Finishing, On Possession, etc.) that predates the
# construction-linked-demand-fix release. See CHANGELOG.md's "Fixed"
# entry for that release — this script is the concrete query it
# references by name.
#
# Every payment-plan milestone used to get a real due date at booking
# time regardless of what it represented, so interest could accrue
# against a construction stage the builder had never actually reached.
# The fix stops this going forward (STAGE_LINKED installments have no
# due date, and therefore no possible accrual, until a stage is raised)
# but does NOT retroactively reverse interest already posted — that is a
# business decision only a human reviewing the specific booking can
# make. This script only lists candidates for that review; it never
# writes anything.
#
# WHY A LABEL HEURISTIC, NOT AN EXACT QUERY: the pre-fix schema never
# captured milestone intent. Installment.milestone_type exists now, but
# every row created BEFORE this migration — including ones that are
# conceptually construction-linked — was backfilled to the column's
# default, DATE_LINKED (correctly: the migration can't retroactively
# know what an old row "meant to be" any more than a human glancing at
# the schema could). The only surviving signal is the label text a
# human typed or a template generated at instantiation time. This
# matches installments.label directly (not payment_plan_milestones.label)
# so it also catches custom (non-template) plans, whose installments
# have no source milestone row to join against at all.
#
# DELIBERATELY EXCLUDES "possession": On Possession is STAGE_LINKED in
# the new model (see docs/plans/construction-linked-demand-fix.md §5),
# but "On Possession" is also the generic, unaffected, always-DATE_LINKED
# terminal milestone of plans like Down Payment Plan. Matching that
# label would flood this report with installments that were never
# affected by the bug. If your install has its own construction-linked
# templates using a distinct label for the possession/handover
# milestone (not literally "On Possession"), add it to --extra-terms.

Usage: sudo ./find-stage-suspect-interest.sh [options]

Read-only. Lists interest_accrual rows against installments whose label
suggests a construction stage, grouped by installment, with the booking
number, installment label, total accrued amount, and the date interest
started accruing against that installment (earliest accrual period start).

  --env-file PATH     Default: /etc/openestate/openestate.env
  --csv               Output CSV instead of an aligned table
  --extra-terms REGEX Additional installment-label pattern to OR into the
                       match (POSIX regex, case-insensitive), e.g. for a
                       custom template's own stage-milestone labels.
