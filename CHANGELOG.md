# Changelog

All notable changes to OpenEstate are documented here. Format loosely
follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## [Unreleased]

### Security

- **`TokenService.rotateRefreshToken`'s grace window is now SPLIT into a
  replay band (E5) and a healing band (pre-E5 CHAIN), tunable via
  `REFRESH_REPLAY_WINDOW_MS` (default 5000).** Presenting a just-revoked
  refresh token now yields different behaviour depending on how recently
  it was revoked:
    - `[0, REFRESH_REPLAY_WINDOW_MS]` — replay. Access token only, no
      refresh cookie set. This is E5's concurrent-burst semantics.
    - `(REFRESH_REPLAY_WINDOW_MS, REFRESH_REUSE_GRACE_SECONDS]` — heal.
      The family's live successor is rotated for the caller and a fresh
      refresh cookie is set. This is the pre-E5 CHAIN behaviour, applied
      only in the healing band.
    - `(REFRESH_REUSE_GRACE_SECONDS, ∞)` — full family revocation.
      Unchanged.
  **Real behavioural difference from E5-as-first-shipped, which
  operators need to know**: a presented revoked token in the healing
  band now yields a REFRESH token, not just an access token. This is
  what the grace window was always designed to permit and matches the
  pre-E5 behaviour every install ran before this rotation-race fix
  landed, but it widens the window during which a stolen-and-replayed
  token yields a fully-usable session (previously the healing-band
  presentation was silently a dead end — a stuck legitimate client was
  logged out at `REFRESH_REUSE_GRACE_SECONDS` regardless of whether the
  presenter was the real user or an attacker). Rationale: the narrower
  E5-only design traded that off against the stuck-client case, and
  that trade-off was wrong in the direction of denying real users
  access after ordinary browser behaviour (a mid-navigation abort that
  prevented the browser committing the winner's Set-Cookie).
  **Scope of the recovery, stated explicitly**: this fix recovers a
  stuck client that re-presents within the heal band — in the real
  client that means a full-page reload (F5 / new tab / browser-restore
  tabs) within `REFRESH_REUSE_GRACE_SECONDS` of the original abort.
  A stuck client that does NOT re-present in that window (idle tab
  past 60s, or a session whose next refresh is driven by the
  15-minute access-token expiry rather than a mount) is still logged
  out at `REFRESH_REUSE_GRACE_SECONDS`, unchanged from E5-only — not
  a regression, but not fixed either. The fix's scope is precisely
  "recover the rapid-reload case E5-only silently killed", and
  everything outside that scope stays exactly as it was.
  Full family revocation for genuine post-window reuse is unchanged. Tune
  or disable via `REFRESH_REPLAY_WINDOW_MS` and
  `REFRESH_REUSE_GRACE_SECONDS` — setting the latter to 0 restores the
  strict pre-fix behaviour and makes the replay window irrelevant.
  Full account in CLAUDE.md's "E5 gap — split the grace window"
  Decisions entry and the `refresh-e5-gap-stuck-client.test.ts`
  regression suite.

- **Reuse-detection could be defeated for one legitimate session under
  exact-concurrency refresh presentation.** `TokenService.rotateRefreshToken`
  did `findFirst → update → create` as three separate auto-committed
  statements, with no interactive transaction and no row lock. Two
  refresh requests arriving within microseconds of each other (a
  browser restoring several tabs, or a Playwright-scale rapid burst)
  could both read the ancestor token as live, both call `rotateRow`,
  and both INSERT a new successor for the same family. Result: the
  family holds TWO live tokens for one legitimate session; only one
  reaches the client's cookie jar and the other is orphaned server-
  side. The family-revocation reuse-detection signal was defeated for
  the exact theft-detection scenario the family model exists to
  catch. Window is narrow (both requests must land in the ~ms between
  the winner's UPDATE and INSERT commits) but the trade-off is real
  and belongs in this callout rather than in the general Fixed list.
  Also produced the more visible symptom of losers 401ing when they
  landed in the OTHER window (loser reads AFTER winner's UPDATE but
  BEFORE the INSERT — sees revoked-within-grace, finds no live
  successor, revokes family, returns 401), which is what CI's
  rapid-reload-session spec surfaced as "parked on /login mid-test".
  Fixed by wrapping `rotateRefreshToken` in a single interactive
  `$transaction` with `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE` on the token row via
  `$queryRaw` — serializes concurrent callers and makes UPDATE+INSERT
  atomic. Grace path switched from CHAIN (rotate the successor) to
  REPLAY (return the successor unchanged; the caller mints an access
  token from the userId but sets no new refresh cookie). Full account
  in CLAUDE.md's "rotateRefreshToken — FOR UPDATE + REPLAY grace path
  (E5)" Decisions entry.

### Removed

- **Docker is gone as an install path.** `deploy/docker-compose.yml`, the
  three Dockerfiles under `deploy/docker/`, `deploy/.env.example`,
  `deploy/nginx/*.conf` and `.dockerignore` are deleted, along with CI's
  container-build job and Dependabot's `docker` ecosystem entry.
  OpenEstate installs natively — `sudo ./deploy/native/install-native.sh`
  against a PostgreSQL/Redis/nginx you run yourself — which has been the
  only supported production path since native install became primary; the
  container stack had already been demoted to unsupported contributor
  tooling and is now removed rather than left to rot untested.
  **If you are still running the old Docker Compose stack**, nothing in
  this release touches a running container and nothing is removed from
  your server — but that stack will receive no further updates. Migrate
  by standing up a native install against the same database
  (`install-native.sh --skip-database` if your PostgreSQL is already
  provisioned) and pointing your reverse proxy at it.
- **Docker is gone from the repo entirely, including for tests.**
  `deploy/docker-compose.test.yml` and `deploy/docker/init-db/` are
  deleted too — no Dockerfile or Compose file exists anywhere in this
  project now. `scripts/test-setup.sh` provisions the test database
  against a PostgreSQL you already run, delegating role creation to
  `deploy/native/setup-database.sh` (the same script a real install
  uses) and writing a `.test-env` you `source` before `pnpm test`.
  Test Postgres/Redis moved from 5433/6380 to the standard 5432/6379,
  since the odd ports only ever existed to avoid colliding with the
  host's own services from inside a container. Two guards come with it:
  the script refuses to run on a cluster that also holds a database
  named `openestate` (the `openestate_app`/`openestate_system` roles
  are cluster-wide and shared with a real install — override with
  `TEST_ALLOW_SHARED_CLUSTER=1`), and `teardown` drops only a database
  whose name ends in `_test`, never the roles.

### Fixed

- **E2E gate was overridden three times in one session because the
  refresh-rotation cascade under CI concurrency logged sessions out
  mid-test.** Under aggressive back-to-back page navigations on 2-core
  CI runners, each mount-time `/auth/refresh` got aborted mid-flight by
  the next navigation; the cookie jar kept re-presenting the same
  token; the server-side grace window forgave each re-presentation with
  a new rotation until the cascade outlived the 30-second window and
  the still-un-updated token tripped replay detection, revoking the
  family and parking the browser on /login. Fixed by adding a 5-second
  sessionStorage cooldown to both `apps/web` and `apps/portal`'s
  `AuthProvider` mount effect — if a successful refresh landed within
  that window, hydrate from a cached JWT PAYLOAD (never the raw token —
  Phase 1's rule protects the raw bearer, not the claims) and skip
  firing another `/auth/refresh`. The cascade never starts. `api()`'s
  401-retry gate was also relaxed to fire without a prior in-memory
  access token so the first API call after a cooldown-skip still works,
  and `REFRESH_REUSE_GRACE_SECONDS` default was bumped from 30 to 60 as
  defence in depth for slightly wider real-world races (multi-tab
  restore, flaky-network double-refresh) — NOT to 120: if the client
  cooldown works, the ceiling is never approached, so widening further
  would hide a client-side regression. Cache is rendering-only, audited
  clean; server remains the sole authorization authority. See CLAUDE.md
  Decisions log for the full account, including why the two prior
  mitigations (`refreshSession()` single-flight, the server grace
  window) each correctly covered their own failure modes but did not
  address this one.
- **CI E2E merge gate now self-audits.** New step in
  `e2e-playwright`: if the job fails but produced no Playwright traces
  in `apps/e2e/test-results/`, it fails loud with a specific message
  stating the merge check must not be overridden without a trace to
  inspect. Traces are now uploaded as their own artifact alongside the
  HTML report. Structural cost added to bypassing the gate, closing the
  incentive that let three overrides land in one session.
- **Correctness bug: construction-linked payment plans could show a
  customer overdue, and accrue delay interest, against a construction
  stage the builder had not reached.** Every payment-plan milestone
  previously got a due date at booking time regardless of what it was
  meant to represent. Installments are now either DATE_LINKED (due at
  booking date + offset — unchanged behaviour) or STAGE_LINKED (no due
  date until a staff user marks the construction stage complete and
  raises demands for it, from a new "Construction Stages" panel on the
  project detail page). **This release does not retroactively reverse
  interest already accrued, or correct demand letters already issued,
  against a stage that may never have actually been reached** — those are
  ledger entries, and reversing them is a business decision only a human
  reviewing the specific booking can make, not something a migration
  should decide for you. **To find potentially affected rows, run
  `deploy/native/find-stage-suspect-interest.sh` on your install** — a
  read-only report (no write, ever) listing every `interest_accrual`
  against an installment whose label suggests a construction/handover
  stage (Excavation, Plinth, Superstructure, Finishing, On Possession,
  etc.), with the booking number, installment label, total accrued
  amount, and the date interest started accruing against it. This is a
  **label-text heuristic, not an exact identification** — the pre-fix
  schema never captured milestone intent, so there is no precise query;
  the script's own header explains exactly what it does and doesn't
  catch (see also its `--extra-terms` flag for a custom template's own
  stage-milestone labels).

### Added

- **Phase A of two-shape inventory (plotted / farmhouse groundwork).**
  Schema-only step: `Project.shape` (HIGH_RISE or LAND_BASED, immutable
  after creation), a shared `AreaUnit` enum (SQFT / SQYD / SQM / ACRE
  / GUNTA), new `inventory_groups` table for LAND_BASED grouping
  (Sector / Block / Cluster / Phase), and the columns a LAND_BASED
  `Unit` needs — `landAreaEntered` + `landAreaEnteredUnit` (source of
  truth for pricing, no divide-through-sqft rounding) plus derived
  `landAreaSqft` for reports, `landRecordRef`, `facing`, `lengthFeet`,
  `breadthFeet`, `rateUnit` (default SQFT), and an optional
  `builtUpRatePaise` for farmhouses that price land and structure
  separately. Existing HIGH_RISE units are backfilled with
  `shape='HIGH_RISE'` and their existing `floor→tower→project` walk;
  every existing booking's ledger stays byte-identical (verified
  directly against the migrated database). A row-level CHECK
  constraint (`units_shape_hierarchy_chk`) enforces the exact
  per-shape hierarchy — HIGH_RISE requires a floor and no group,
  LAND_BASED forbids a floor — so a wrong-shape row can never be
  written. LAND_BASED create/booking paths are NOT wired yet; this
  release only lands the schema so those follow-ups can be reviewed
  in isolation.

- **Phase B of two-shape inventory: LAND_BASED create/booking paths
  are now wired.** `POST /projects/:id/units/land-based` creates a
  plot directly on a project (no floor); `landAreaSqft` is always
  derived server-side from the entered (value, unit) pair, never
  accepted from the client. `GET/POST /projects/:id/inventory-groups`
  and `PATCH/DELETE /inventory-groups/:id` manage Sector/Block/Cluster
  grouping (deactivate, not hard-delete — a group's units simply
  ungroup, never silently vanish). The existing tower/floor-scoped
  endpoints now 400 with a clear message on a LAND_BASED project
  instead of creating an unreachable row. A new `BookingCostLineVerifier`
  recomputes a LAND_BASED booking's BASE cost line from the unit's own
  stored rate/area and rejects the request if the client's submitted
  amount is off by more than 1 paise — closes the same "trust the
  client's JS math" gap this project already tightened for GST
  place-of-supply, specifically for the harder LAND_BASED arithmetic
  (Decimal areas, per-acre rates in the tens of millions of paise).
  HIGH_RISE pricing is deliberately untouched — it has never been a
  computed rate-times-area value in this codebase, staff routinely
  negotiate an agreed price different from a unit's listed rate, and a
  strict verifier there would reject legitimate pricing, not catch a
  bug. The customer portal's property page now renders a LAND_BASED
  booking correctly (group name + plot number, or bare "Plot N" when
  ungrouped, plus the entered land area) instead of the raw tower/floor
  layout HIGH_RISE uses. New permission `inventory.inventory-group.manage`
  (granted to `company_admin` automatically via its existing wildcard;
  `sales_manager` gets it too, but — matching this project's own
  privilege-escalation-on-upgrade lesson — only on a fresh install or
  an explicit role edit, never auto-granted to an existing install's
  role on upgrade).

  Also fixed, found auditing every remaining `floor.tower.projectId`
  traversal for this release: a customer whose booking is against a
  LAND_BASED unit previously got a raw 500 on their own property page
  (`PortalPropertyService` read `.floor.tower...` unguarded) — worse,
  even a null-safe read would have found nothing, because four portal
  RLS policies (`projects_portal_scope` and three others) only reached
  a project via the same floor/tower chain, invisible to Postgres for a
  floorless unit. Both layers fixed; a LAND_BASED customer can now
  actually see their own project. Several report/list queries
  (`postsales-reports.service.ts`'s rollups and dues report,
  `unit.service.ts`'s list, `rate-revision.service.ts`, the units XLSX
  export, the construction-update notification fan-out, the project-edit
  confirmation dialog's booking count) had the identical traversal bug —
  silently returning zero rows for a LAND_BASED project instead of
  crashing, which is why they went unnoticed until this audit rather
  than being reported. All now resolve via `Unit.projectId` directly.

- **Phase C of two-shape inventory: staff app UI, and the create-project
  API gap this finally exposed.** `POST /projects` never accepted a
  `shape` field at all before this — every project has been HIGH_RISE
  by the database default, regardless of what a caller sent, since
  Phase A shipped the schema. The project-create wizard now has a
  shape picker (High-rise / Land-based, high-rise the default) and a
  default land-area unit shown only for a land-based project; `shape`
  is immutable after creation (rejected by the update endpoint, same
  treatment as the project code). Project detail's inventory tab is
  now shape-conditional — Towers for high-rise, Inventory Groups
  (Sector/Block/Cluster) for land-based, with its own plot create form
  (land area entered + unit, land record ref, facing, dimensions, rate
  unit, built-up rate) and a flat plot list with group and status
  filters. The booking wizard's unit-selection step gained an optional
  group filter for land-based projects, and — the one that actually
  protects real money — no longer pre-fills the agreed base price from
  a land-based unit's raw `baseRatePaise`, which is paise PER the
  unit's rate unit (e.g. per acre), not a flat price the way it is for
  a high-rise unit; it now computes the real total client-side (the
  same `computeBaseAmountPaise` formula the server's
  `BookingCostLineVerifier` already used to check it), with the server
  verifier remaining the authoritative check at submit either way.
  LAND_BASED bulk import/export gained its own XLSX column layout (no
  tower/floor columns, an optional group code and the entered-area
  pair instead) and a `GET /projects/:id/units/import-template`
  endpoint so the template can never drift from what a real upload
  requires — column choice is derived from the schema, not a real
  client sheet (none was available for this release); flagged as
  needing validation against a real LAND_BASED inventory sheet before
  a pilot import.

  Also fixed, found registering the new import-template route: `GET
  /projects/:id/units/export` and the new `import-template` route
  would have been silently swallowed by `UnitController`'s `GET :id`
  route (matching `id="export"`/`id="import-template"`) — the exact
  route-registration-order bug class this project's own v0.3.1 lesson
  documents for `GET /inquiries/import-template`. Reordered the
  controllers array with a comment explaining why the order is
  load-bearing, so a future cleanup doesn't silently reintroduce it.

- **Phase 0 of the feature-completion plan: a configurable lead-stage
  pipeline.** A new Admin → Lead Stages master lets a company define its
  own sales-pipeline positions (seeded by default with New, Contacted,
  Site Visit Scheduled, Site Visit Done, Negotiation, Documentation) —
  separate from, and orthogonal to, an inquiry's existing Open/Continued/
  Dumped/Successful status. `InquiryDetail` gained a Stage picker; every
  stage change (including the initial one at creation, from the
  interactive form, the inbound lead API, or bulk import) writes an
  append-only history row, so a lead's full stage trail is always
  reconstructible. Deactivating a stage that still has active leads on it
  requires picking another stage to move them to first — mirroring the
  existing booking-count confirmation pattern elsewhere in the admin
  screens; that reassignment is flagged in the history as an
  administrative move rather than a real pipeline advance, so a later
  funnel report can tell the difference between a rep converting a lead
  and an admin retiring a stage that happened to be holding thousands of
  them. Existing installs get the default pipeline delivered on
  upgrade, the same one-time-marker-gated delivery mechanism the
  permission-sync fix already established — an admin who has since
  renamed or deleted a seeded stage is never overwritten. This release
  lands the pipeline and the audit trail only; a Kanban-style board and a
  stage-based funnel report are separate, later phases. The stage
  currently marked default can't be deactivated until another stage is
  set as the default first, and a stage can only ever be retired by
  deactivating it — there is no delete.

- **Pre-sales reporting suite.** A single `Reports` screen under
  Pre-Sales, driven by one filter bar (date range, project, and a
  per-report executive/reason filter where relevant) and one reusable
  table/chart pattern, replacing the previous zero-UI state — every
  report in this release was already backend-only or entirely new; none
  had a screen before. Nine reports are new: Daily Work (per-user
  follow-ups logged / leads touched / stage changes / dispositions set),
  Leads by Stage, Dump report (by reason/executive/time), Site Visit
  report, Enquiry-type breakdown (Fresh/Resale/Rental/Commercial — a
  different axis from the existing Source-wise report, not a rename of
  it), Stage Transitions and Stage Velocity (`InquiryStageHistory`,
  excluding administrative bulk-reassignment moves), Follow-up Overdue
  (a live gauge, ignores the date filter by design) and Follow-up Delay
  (average gap between a follow-up's next-action date and the follow-up
  that actually closed it), Supervisor Review Queue (dumped + transferred
  leads, for the SOP-mandated weekly review), and Communication-type
  breakdown (`FollowUpType`, not `CommunicationType`). Two existing
  reports — Source-wise and Staff Performance — gained a second,
  **booking-linked** conversion percentage (via `Booking.sourceInquiryId`)
  shown side by side with the existing status-based one, never replacing
  it: the gap between "marked Successful" and "has a real booking behind
  it" is itself a signal a manager can act on. Every report is scoped
  through `TeamScopeService` (a sales exec sees their own data, a manager
  their subtree, an admin everything) — no report hand-rolls its own
  owner filter, enforced by a widened CI guard (see Fixed, below).
  Charts are hand-rolled inline SVG bar/donut, no charting library.
  CSV export and print are gated by two new permissions,
  `presales.report.export` and `presales.report.print`, kept separate
  from `presales.report.view` specifically so a role can read a report
  on-screen without being able to take customer PII out of the system —
  every export and print writes an audit-log row (who, which report,
  what filters, row count) before the response is sent, the control 4QT
  had as "Print/Download Track." Row-level reports (per-inquiry export,
  dump report, site visit, supervisor review queue) stream their CSV via
  the existing `streamCsv` utility instead of buffering.
  **Upgrade-path note**: `company_admin` and `sales_manager` inherit both
  new permissions automatically (the `presales.*` prefix filter in
  `roles.ts`), but only for a role created fresh from today onward — on
  an EXISTING install, that prefix filter doesn't retroactively re-grant
  anything, so an admin must grant `presales.report.export`/
  `presales.report.print` to those roles manually via Admin → Roles
  after upgrading if export/print access is wanted (view access needs no
  action — `sales_executive` already had `presales.report.view` before
  this release, and every role's existing grants are otherwise
  untouched). `sales_executive` gets `presales.report.view` only, not
  export or print, in both a fresh install and on upgrade (added
  directly to its `ROLE_PERMISSIONS` entry, not inherited via a prefix
  filter) — reports are already scoped to that rep's own data, but a
  portable CSV/print copy of it stays manager+ only by default.

### Fixed

- **Reloading a few times, or letting your browser restore several tabs,
  could log you out.** Every page load refreshes the session; if that
  response never reached the browser — you navigated again, the browser
  restored several tabs at once, the response was simply lost — the
  server had already consumed the token and issued a replacement the
  browser never received. Re-presenting the old one was then treated as
  token theft and killed the whole session. It landed you on the login
  screen with no explanation, and it could never be reproduced on
  demand. Refresh-token rotation now allows a short grace window
  (`REFRESH_REUSE_GRACE_SECONDS`, default 30) for re-presenting a
  just-consumed token when the session chain is otherwise intact.
  Genuine replay — after the window, or once the session has been
  revoked — still revokes everything exactly as before. Affects staff
  and portal alike; both share one rotation path.

- **An upgrade could hang indefinitely instead of failing.**
  `upgrade-native.sh` runs migrations before cutover, deliberately, while
  the previous release is still serving. A schema change needing an
  exclusive table lock therefore waits on live traffic — and with no
  timeout it waited forever, with later queries queueing behind it so the
  app froze rather than the upgrade merely being slow. Migrations now run
  with a `lock_timeout` (15s, override with `MIGRATION_LOCK_TIMEOUT`), so
  a contended upgrade aborts quickly and leaves the previous release
  running and untouched — the intended failure mode. If you hit the new
  error, retry during a quieter period.

- **A custom "Administrator" role saw only its own subtree.** Whether a
  role sees the whole company was decided by its slug being literally
  `company_admin` or `super_admin`, so a company that built its own
  full-permission admin role was silently scoped to its own reporting
  line — its dashboard and reports showed a fraction of the company with
  no error to explain why. That decision now keys off a permission
  (`admin.team-scope.all`), which the seeded `company_admin` and
  `super_admin` roles receive automatically, including on upgrade. Grant
  it to any custom admin-equivalent role of your own via Admin → Roles.
  Deliberately not granted to `sales_manager`: seeing your own subtree
  is the point of the hierarchy.

- **Manager-wise interaction counts silently ignored the team hierarchy,
  and the CI guard meant to catch exactly this class of bug didn't
  either.** `managerWiseInteractions` picked which users are managers via
  a bare `role: { slug: 'sales_manager' }` filter — a legitimate way to
  select the report's axis — but then counted only each manager's own
  directly-logged follow-ups, never `TeamScopeService`'s real subtree, so
  a manager's team roll-up silently undercounted the moment they had any
  reports. `team-scope-guard.test.ts`'s existing checks (a bare
  `SYSTEM_ROLES.SALES_EXECUTIVE` identifier; a bare
  `where.assignedToId =`/`where.createdById =` scalar assignment) didn't
  fire on this shape at all — a `role: { slug: ... }` query filter is
  neither. Found while building the reporting suite above; the guard was
  widened with a third check for exactly this pattern (verified it
  correctly failed against the pre-fix code before the method itself was
  fixed, the same discipline this project applies to every other
  guard/regression pair), and the method now calls
  `TeamScopeService.getVisibleUserIds` per manager to get their real
  subtree.

### Changed

- **The dashboard's conversion figure no longer drifts.** It counted
  inquiries whose status was SUCCESSFUL and whose `updatedAt` fell in
  the current month — but `updatedAt` moves on ANY edit, so adding a
  note to a lead closed last year silently counted it as this month's
  conversion and changed a manager's team-performance number. Inquiries
  now carry a real `convertedAt`, stamped when the status becomes
  SUCCESSFUL and cleared if it moves back out.

  **Historical figures are approximate.** Inquiries closed before this
  release have `convertedAt` backfilled from `updatedAt` — the same
  approximation the old figure already used, so no number you have seen
  changes as a result of upgrading; they simply stop drifting from here
  on. Where a closed lead was edited after the fact, its recorded
  conversion date is that later edit, which is not recoverable after the
  fact and has not been guessed at. Figures from this release onward are
  exact.

## [0.4.0]

Lead ownership and manager hierarchy — the second half of the v0.3.1
pilot-user triage's "big one," deferred out of that release for its own
design pass. Adds `User.managerId` and a proper reporting-subtree
visibility model, fixes a real security bug found while auditing the
existing scoping, and changes what non-admin roles can see.

### Security

- **A sales executive could read, create, and update follow-ups on any
  colleague's inquiry, just by knowing its id — bypassing the
  inquiry-level scoping entirely.** `FollowUpController` only ever
  checked `companyId`, never whether the caller could actually see the
  parent inquiry. This is a live bug that has been shipping since
  follow-ups were built, not something introduced by this release — it
  surfaced during the audit for the manager-hierarchy work below. Fixed:
  every follow-up read/create/update now confirms the parent inquiry is
  in the caller's visible set first. If you have sales executives who
  shouldn't see each other's pipelines, upgrade — this was open on every
  prior version.

### Changed — behavioral change for existing installs, read this before upgrading

- **Before this release, every role except `sales_executive` — including
  `sales_manager` — saw the ENTIRE company's inquiries and reports.**
  Only `sales_executive` was restricted to their own queue; every other
  role had no real scoping at all, just a blanket "see everything."
  After this release, every role other than `company_admin`/
  `super_admin` sees only their own reporting subtree, computed from
  `User.managerId`. This is the correct behavior — it's the entire point
  of this release — but it is a real, visible change: **a user with no
  `managerId` set will see only their own leads after upgrading, even if
  they used to see the whole company.** Configure your org chart (set
  each manager's reports' `managerId`) after upgrading, before your
  managers ask where their team's leads went — otherwise this will look
  like the release lost their data, not like a permissions model working
  as intended.

### Added

- **`User.managerId`** — set a user's manager from the Add/Edit User
  form. Drives who can see whose leads, applicants' inquiries, and
  reports: a manager sees their own work plus their FULL reporting
  subtree (not just direct reports), computed live on every request — no
  caching, so a manager change takes effect immediately for whoever it
  affects, no re-login needed. Cycle-safe: the form (and the API) reject
  a manager assignment that would create a loop.
- **Every inquiry list/detail/update/assign endpoint, and both the
  pre-sales and post-sales report modules, are now scoped by this
  hierarchy** via a new `TeamScopeService`, replacing three separate
  hand-rolled scoping checks with one.
- **Manager-level users with zero reports configured now see an inline
  hint on the Inquiries list** ("Your team has no reports configured
  yet...") pointing at Admin → Users, instead of a silent "No data
  found" that's indistinguishable from actually having no leads. Closes
  the exact confusion the behavioral change above would otherwise cause.

## [0.3.1]

First real pilot-user feedback, triaged and fixed. Three critical bugs
(hit hourly by a working sales team), two "check before building" items
that turned out to be backend-complete, and a security leak found along
the way.

### Security

- **Credential leak, fixed: staff-facing inquiry and follow-up
  endpoints returned password hashes, TOTP secrets, and recovery codes
  to any authenticated staff user.** `GET /inquiries`, `GET
  /inquiries/:id`, and `GET /inquiries/:id/follow-ups` embedded the
  full `User` row for `assignedTo`/`createdBy` — including
  `passwordHash`, `totpSecret`, and `recoveryCodes` — because a bare
  Prisma `include: { relation: true }` returns every scalar column on
  the related model, not just the ones the UI displays. Any staff user
  with read access to inquiries (not just admins) could see this data
  in their browser's network tab on every list/detail/follow-up load.
  Fixed by scoping both call sites (`InquiryService.findAll`/
  `findOne`, `FollowUpService.findAllForInquiry`) to explicit `select`s
  (`{id, name, email}` / `{id, name}`), verified absent both in a
  through-the-wire regression test and by inspecting raw response JSON
  on a live deployed instance. **If you are running v0.3.0 or earlier,
  upgrade to v0.3.1 and rotate any staff password or TOTP secret you
  consider exposed** — anyone who had inquiry-read access and inspected
  network traffic (or logs, if any client/proxy captured response
  bodies) during that window could have captured these values.

### Fixed

- **A rep's own inquiry could silently reassign to admin.** `InquiryService.create()`
  ran round-robin unconditionally whenever a project was set, with no
  notion of who created the inquiry — `Inquiry` had no `createdById`
  column at all. New default policy: an interactively-created inquiry is
  assigned straight to its creator; round-robin only runs for
  machine-driven intake (inbound lead API, bulk import), which has no
  human creator to retain ownership for. Configurable via
  `CompanyConfig.presalesCreatorRetainsLead` (default on).
- **Editing a user, for any field, always failed.** `UserForm.tsx`'s
  edit-mode submit sent a create-shaped payload (including `email`) to a
  `.strict()` update endpoint that never declared it — every save 400'd.
  A deeper client-side bug sat in front of it: the form's validation
  resolver was always `createUserSchema`, which requires `password` —
  edit mode never renders that field, so submission failed silently at
  the validation layer before a request was ever sent. Both fixed; a new
  shared `pickForSchema()` helper (projects onto an update schema's own
  declared keys, rather than subtracting fields off a create-shaped
  object) closes the class of bug, applied at all three known sites
  (this one, Masters, Broker commission payment) plus a regression test
  covering every create/update schema pair this package exports.
- **Direct URL access to an admin page rendered the full page shell for
  any authenticated user**, regardless of permission — the backend
  correctly 403'd the underlying data fetch, but nothing distinguished
  "no data yet" from "not allowed here." Every protected route now
  renders an access-denied screen instead when the user lacks the
  permission that gates it.

### Added

- **Bulk Excel inquiry import now has a staff UI.** The backend
  (row-level validation, applicant dedup, `ExcelJS`-based parsing) has
  existed since Phase 3 with no caller in `apps/web` — upload UI, a
  downloadable XLSX template (`GET /inquiries/import-template`, single
  source of truth shared with the parser's own header map), and
  per-row error reporting added to the Inquiries page.
- **Follow-up log now shows who logged it.** `FollowUp.createdById` has
  been captured since Phase 3 and was already being fetched — just never
  rendered.

## [0.3.0]

### Added

- **Staff can now publish construction updates and photos to the customer
  portal.** Backend and portal rendering have been complete since v0.2.2
  — nothing in the staff app ever called the endpoint, so a builder
  could never post an update through the product and the portal's
  "Construction progress" section only ever showed something if a
  developer hand-crafted one via the raw API. `ProjectDetail.tsx` gained
  a Construction Updates panel (mirrors the existing Media panel):
  create an update (title, description, date), attach photos (reusing
  the existing upload module and per-project storage cap), list
  existing updates, delete one. Publishing already fires the existing
  portal-notification trigger — no wiring needed there.

- **You can now edit a project after creation.** There was previously no
  edit screen at all — a typo'd RERA number or address meant rebuilding
  the project and its entire inventory. `ProjectDetail.tsx` now has an
  Edit Project form for name, RERA number, project type, area/location,
  address, description, and start/expected-end dates, reusing the same
  custom-field inputs as project creation. `PATCH /projects/:id` already
  existed and was already permission-gated (`INVENTORY_PROJECT_UPDATE`)
  — this release only adds the missing UI, plus one backend change:
  `code` is now immutable (dropped from the update schema, shown
  read-only) since it's used to match projects during bulk inquiry CSV
  import — changing it would silently break existing CSV mappings.

  Editing a project's area/location changes GST place-of-supply for
  **new** bookings only — every existing booking's GST is a one-time
  snapshot taken at booking creation and is never retroactively altered
  (same immutable-snapshot design as rate-master edits). When the
  project already has bookings, changing the area/location now shows a
  confirmation naming the booking count before saving, so the
  consequence is visible rather than silent; projects with zero bookings
  save immediately with no extra step.

### Fixed

- **Upgrading an existing install left the Super Admin role unable to use
  newly-shipped features.** Since v0.2.0, upgrades correctly added new
  permission *rows* to the database, but never granted them to anyone —
  so on any install created before a given release, the `super_admin`
  role kept exactly the permissions it was first seeded with. In
  practice this meant **PLC and unit-charge pricing (shipped in v0.2.0)
  was unreachable on every upgraded install**, for the most privileged
  role in the product, with no error message explaining why. Found on a
  real v0.1.2 → v0.2.3 upgrade: the `permissions` table held all 142
  rows while `super_admin` held only 140.

  Upgrades now re-grant `super_admin` any permission it is missing.
  This runs automatically as part of `upgrade-native.sh` — no manual
  step. **If you have upgraded before and found a feature missing from
  the UI, this is very likely why**; re-running the upgrade repairs it.

  Only `super_admin` is repaired, deliberately. Its definition *is*
  "every permission that exists", so a missing one is drift rather than
  a choice. `company_admin`, `sales_manager` and any custom role are
  left exactly as configured — an upgrade must never silently widen a
  permission set an admin deliberately narrowed. Grant new permissions
  to those roles through Admin → Roles.

- `packages/db` imported `@openestate/shared` in two shipped scripts
  (`seed.ts`, `sync-permissions.ts`) without declaring it as a
  dependency; it resolved only by package-manager hoisting. Now
  declared explicitly.

- **Correctness fix: a booking's cost lines could silently price at 0%
  GST.** A booking's `BASE` cost line had no GST rate picker anywhere in
  the wizard, and every PLC/charge line without its own rate falls back
  to the base line's — so with no rate ever set on the base line, an
  entire booking (base price, PLC, and any charge type without its own
  configured GST rate) taxed at 0%, with no error and no on-screen
  signal. Unlike the other gaps found on the same pre-pilot walkthrough,
  this one produces a printed document — a demand letter, a statement —
  with the wrong tax amount and nothing to flag it, the same failure
  shape as the bounced-cheque-still-counted-as-collected bug fixed
  earlier this project's history. Fixed at the point of resolution, not
  just in the UI: `BookingService.createBooking` now rejects the whole
  booking (full rollback, no partial row written) if any cost line's GST
  rate can't be resolved through the existing own → charge-type →
  base-line chain, naming the specific line and pointing at the base
  line first since setting it fixes every line that falls back to it.
  `BookingWizard.tsx` gained a GST-rate picker on the base line
  (auto-selected only when exactly one active rate exists — never
  guessed otherwise) so a real admin hits this before submitting, not
  after.

  **Bookings created before this fix are not retroactively corrected.**
  `BookingCostLine` is an immutable snapshot by design (the same
  invariant behind rate-master edits never touching an existing
  booking), and there is no way to know after the fact what the correct
  historical GST rate should have been without a human reviewing each
  affected booking — the same reasoning already applied to the
  `CompanyConfig.gstStateCode` correctness fix. A boot-time log
  (non-fatal, mirrors the existing GST-config-completeness check) and a
  persistent admin banner now surface a count of affected bookings
  instead, linking to a new "Zero-GST bookings" report
  (`Post-sales → Reports`, CSV export included) listing the exact
  booking numbers — **check any already-issued document for these
  bookings before relying on it.**

- **A company's first-ever, open-ended GST rate blocked creating a
  second one.** The overlap check correctly refused two ambiguous,
  simultaneously-active date ranges — but the only way out was for the
  admin to notice the confusing error and manually set an end date on
  the first rate before trying again. Creating a rate that would
  overlap an existing open-ended range now auto-closes the prior range
  the day before the new one starts, instead of rejecting — safe
  because GST is snapshotted per cost line at booking time, never
  looked up by date range at runtime. A genuinely ambiguous overlap (a
  fixed-range rate, or a new range starting on/before an existing one)
  is still rejected, now naming the conflicting rate.

  **The seed itself shipped exactly this invalid state** — GST 5% and
  GST 12% both open-ended from the same date — so every fresh install
  started with master data the product's own validation would reject
  if resubmitted. Fixed with real, verifiable dates: GST 12% now models
  the pre-April-2019 scheme (closed), GST 5% the current one
  (open-ended).

- **A GST/TDS rate's end date could be set once and never cleared
  again.** `PATCH` with an explicit `effectiveTo: null` silently
  coerced to `1970-01-01` instead of clearing the column (the
  underlying date-coercion library treats `null` as a valid date, epoch,
  not as "no value" — an easy trap without an explicit guard).
  `Masters.tsx` also never sent `null` for an emptied date field, so
  even the fixed backend was unreachable from the UI. Both fixed; same
  class of bug audited across every other optional date field in the
  schema (Project's start/expected-end dates included).

- Native installs: a fresh `sudo git clone` (as documented) leaves the
  checkout root-owned, and Git's dubious-ownership protection then
  refused every `git` command a non-root admin ran against it
  afterward — including the routine `git pull` before every upgrade.
  `install-native.sh`/`upgrade-native.sh` now add the necessary
  exception automatically.

## [0.2.3]

### Security

- **Custom field values are no longer sent to portal users.** Until this
  release, `GET /portal/profile` returned the customer's whole applicant
  record — including any admin-defined custom field values — to the
  customer themselves **and to their co-applicants**. Custom fields are
  routinely used by staff for internal notes ("negotiation margin",
  "credit risk", "do not call before 11am"), and nothing in the field
  definition marks a field as safe to show a customer, so all of them
  are now withheld from every portal response. Per-field opt-in
  visibility is a deliberate future feature; withholding is the only
  defensible default in the meantime.

  **If your staff have written anything sensitive into a custom field on
  an Applicant, assume portal users could have seen it before
  upgrading.** Values themselves are untouched — only what the portal
  returns has changed.

### Fixed

- **Integrity fix: custom field values have accepted arbitrary,
  unvalidated data since Phase 3 — your database may already contain
  junk.** `customFields` on Applicant and Inquiry was declared as
  "any object" at the API boundary (`z.record(z.unknown())`), so any
  caller could write any key with any value straight into storage: no
  type checking, no required-field checking, no check that a SELECT
  value was one of its options, and no rejection of keys that were never
  defined as custom fields at all. The validation code to prevent this
  had been written but was never called by anything.

  Validation is now enforced server-side against your active field
  definitions on every write, for Applicant, Inquiry, Unit and Project.
  Unknown keys are **rejected** rather than silently discarded.

  To see whether an existing install has junk values, run this against
  your database — it lists every stored key that has no matching custom
  field definition:

  ```sql
  SELECT 'applicant' AS entity, a.id, k AS unknown_key, a.custom_fields -> k AS value
    FROM applicants a, jsonb_object_keys(a.custom_fields) k
   WHERE a.custom_fields IS NOT NULL
     AND NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM custom_field_definitions d
                      WHERE d.company_id = a.company_id
                        AND d.entity_type = 'APPLICANT' AND d.key = k)
  UNION ALL
  SELECT 'inquiry', i.id, k, i.custom_fields -> k
    FROM inquiries i, jsonb_object_keys(i.custom_fields) k
   WHERE i.custom_fields IS NOT NULL
     AND NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM custom_field_definitions d
                      WHERE d.company_id = i.company_id
                        AND d.entity_type = 'INQUIRY' AND d.key = k);
  ```

  Anything it returns is either junk written before the fix, or one of
  two expected system-written keys (`leadNote` from inbound leads,
  `importNotes` from CSV import). Values belonging to a field you merely
  *deactivated* will **not** appear — that definition still exists, so
  those values are accounted for.

  **Nothing is deleted by upgrading.** Existing values are preserved and
  still shown on detail screens, marked "(inactive)" where no active
  definition covers them, and records carrying such keys stay editable —
  validation rejects unknown keys arriving from a client, but never
  retroactively invalidates what is already stored.

- Deleting a custom field used to be a hard delete, which left its
  values orphaned in the database with nothing left to explain what they
  meant. Delete is now a **deactivate** (values preserved, field stops
  appearing on forms). Permanently destroying values is a separate
  action that requires typing the field's key to confirm, and records
  the affected row count to the audit log.

### Added

- **Custom field values now actually work.** Admins could define custom
  fields since Phase 1, but nothing anywhere captured or displayed a
  *value* — defining a field had no effect elsewhere in the product.
  Values are now captured on real forms, validated, displayed on detail
  screens, and exported. Supported on **Applicant, Inquiry, Unit and
  Project**; a field's definition drives the form with no code change.
- New per-inquiry CSV export (`/reports/presales/inquiries-export`) with
  one column per active custom field.
- `BOOKING` is explicitly marked unsupported in the admin UI (with an
  explanation) and rejected by the API, rather than letting an admin
  define a field there that would silently do nothing. See
  `docs/todo.md`.

## [0.2.2]

### Added

- **Layout plan / brochure / photo uploads.** `UploadService` has
  supported these categories since Phase 2 but no route ever called it
  — this release wires it up. Staff get a **Media** panel on a
  project's detail page (upload, list, download, delete); customers
  see the same files under a new "Layout plans & brochures" section on
  the portal Property page, with real download links.
- **Construction-progress photos actually render now.** The upload
  path for `ConstructionUpdateMedia` has existed since v0.2.1's own
  predecessor, but there was never a serving route on either side —
  the portal only ever showed a photo *count*. Staff and portal both
  gained a download route, and the portal Property page now renders
  the real images inline instead of a bare "N photo(s)" line.
- **Per-project storage cap.** Layout plans, brochures, photos, and
  construction-progress photos all roll up disk usage under one
  project — unbounded uploads on a self-hosted box eventually fill the
  disk, which surfaces as Postgres refusing writes and looks like
  total system failure rather than a storage problem. A configurable
  file-count cap (default 50) and total-size cap (default 500MB) per
  project are enforced before any file touches disk, with a clear
  error naming the limit. Configurable via Company Config
  (`projectMediaMaxFiles`/`projectMediaMaxBytes`).
- IDOR coverage for both new download routes: a customer with a
  booking in one project cannot fetch another project's media by
  guessing an id — proven via the same raw-connection RLS discipline
  as every other portal IDOR test in this codebase, since both
  `project_media`/`construction_update_media`'s portal RLS predicates
  are multi-hop and therefore not mirrored at the JS layer.
- Two new e2e Playwright scenarios: staff uploads a layout plan
  through the real UI and the customer downloads it in the portal;
  and a staff-published construction-progress photo renders as a real
  decoded image in the portal (not just a 200 response).

### Still missing

- **Custom field values.** Admins can define custom fields (Applicant,
  Unit, etc.) via Admin → Custom Fields, but no form anywhere in either
  app captures or displays a *value* for one — defining a field has no
  effect elsewhere in the product yet.

## [0.2.1]

### Added

- **Staff can now reply to and resolve customer support tickets.**
  Closes the loop that's been open since the portal shipped: customers
  could raise a ticket and read replies, but no staff screen existed to
  see or answer one — the backend (`AdminTicketController`) had been
  fully built and idle the whole time. New **Support** section
  (top-level nav, not nested under Post-sales — inquiries and brokers
  raise tickets too, not just post-sales) with a queue and a thread
  view: reply, change status, filter by status.
- **Ticket queue enrichment.** The queue now shows who raised each
  ticket (resolved from the linked Applicant/Broker, not a bare ID),
  its category, how many messages it has, and when it was last active
  — the minimum a triaging staff member needs to work a queue, none of
  which the API returned before.
- **Overdue flagging from the existing `slaByAt` field.** The column
  has existed in the schema since Phase 6 with nothing reading it; the
  queue now shows an "Overdue" flag when a ticket's `slaByAt` has
  passed and it isn't resolved/closed. No SLA policy or configuration
  was added — this only renders a field that was already there.
- The e2e harness gained its first scenario that drives **both**
  `apps/web` and `apps/portal` against the same API in one test:
  customer raises a ticket → staff sees it, replies, resolves it →
  customer sees the reply. Every prior scenario exercised one app at a
  time.

### Still missing

Two gaps remain, tracked for future releases, not fixed here:

- **Layout plan / brochure / photo uploads.** The validation and
  storage service (`UploadService`) has existed since Phase 2 and
  already supports these categories, but no route in the Inventory
  module has ever called it — there is no way, staff or customer
  portal, to attach or view a project's layout plan today.
- **Custom field values.** Admins can define custom fields (Applicant,
  Unit, etc.) via Admin → Custom Fields, but no form anywhere in either
  app captures or displays a *value* for one — defining a field has no
  effect elsewhere in the product yet.

## [0.2.0]

**Upgrade note:** `upgrade-native.sh` now syncs new `PERMISSIONS` rows to
existing installs automatically (see the permission-delivery fix below),
but it does not — and should not — grant them to any role for you. After
upgrading, an admin must open **Admin → Roles**, edit each role that
should get the new PLC/charge-management capability, check
`inventory.unit.plc-manage` / `inventory.unit.charge-manage`, and save.
This is a deliberate, permissions-only sync — see the entry below for why
auto-granting them would be its own bug, not a fix.

### Fixed

- **Correctness fix affecting GST charged on bookings and extra charges —
  check your invoices if your company's GST State Code was ever unset.**
  `isIntraStateSupply()` used to silently default to intra-state
  (CGST+SGST) whenever the company's GST state code or a booking's
  place-of-supply state code was missing, instead of raising an error.
  Any company whose Company Config GST fields were never filled in —
  every install created before those columns existed, or any install
  where nobody had visited Company Config yet — has been charging
  CGST+SGST on every booking and extra charge regardless of where the
  property actually is, which is the WRONG tax treatment (IGST) whenever
  the real place of supply is in a different state from the company's
  own. This produced no error and no warning; the only way to notice was
  to already know the correct treatment and check by hand. **If this
  applies to you, review bookings/extra charges made while your GST
  config was incomplete and correct any wrongly-taxed invoices — this
  release does not retroactively fix already-issued invoices.** Going
  forward, `isIntraStateSupply()` now throws instead of guessing — a
  booking or extra charge with incomplete GST config is rejected with a
  clear error naming what to set in Company Config, rather than silently
  taxed wrong. The app also now logs a warning at boot listing any
  company with incomplete GST config, and the staff admin UI shows a
  persistent banner linking to Company Config until it's completed.

- **Correctness fix affecting reported collection figures — upgrade and
  let the migration run before trusting any collection report.** A prior
  bug (see the REPORTS-phase entry in `CLAUDE.md`) left bounced-cheque
  receipts still marked as collected (`is_reversed = false`) in every
  collection report, rollup, and the customer portal's own payment
  history — the code fix stops this going forward, but does nothing for
  receipts that already bounced before you upgrade. Migration
  `20260804120000_backfill_bounced_receipt_is_reversed` corrects those
  existing rows on your next `prisma migrate deploy` (part of the normal
  upgrade path — no manual step needed). It only touches the
  `is_reversed`/`reversal_reason` flag on affected receipts; it does not
  alter any ledger entry, allocation, or installment. If your reported
  collection totals looked too high before upgrading, they'll drop by
  the sum of any previously-bounced cheques once this runs.

- **A release that adds a `PERMISSIONS` constant never reached an
  existing install — only a fresh one.** `seed.ts`'s permission-upsert
  loop ran unconditionally, but the early-return gate right after it
  (`if (existingCompany) return`) meant no other seeded content, and
  critically no *later* permission addition, was ever re-applied to a
  company created in an earlier release. `upgrade-native.sh` now runs a
  dedicated `sync-permissions.ts` step (idempotent, permissions-table
  only) on every upgrade, so new permission rows reach existing installs
  the same way they reach fresh ones. Deliberately does NOT extend to
  masters or roles — see the upgrade note above and `CLAUDE.md` for why
  that's a different (and mostly correct-as-is) problem.
- **A system role (`super_admin`, `company_admin`, etc.) could never be
  granted a newly-added permission through the UI, at all.**
  `RolesService.update()` rejected any change to a system role, not just
  a rename — so even with the fix above delivering the permission *row*,
  there was no way to actually grant it to a role. Scoped the guard to
  an actual name change only; a system role's permission set is now
  freely editable (its name and existence stay protected, as before).

### Added

- **PLC and unit-charge management.** Unit-level PLCs (park-facing,
  corner, etc.) and extra charges (IFMS, legal, etc.) can now be
  assigned per unit from the Inventory → Project → Pricing panel, and
  flow into a booking's cost breakup and the confirm step's total
  automatically. PLC amounts are snapshotted in paise at assignment time
  (from a percentage of the unit's rate, or a flat amount) and never
  retroactively change if the base rate is revised later.
- **Per-charge-type GST rates.** Charge Types now carry their own
  optional GST rate and HSN/SAC code (Masters → Charge Types). A cost
  line's GST resolves in order: its own rate, then its charge type's
  rate, then the booking's base-line rate — never silently zero-rated.
  A PLC line has no charge type, so it always inherits the base line's
  rate; this is stated explicitly rather than left implicit.

### Changed

- Replaced the `argon2` password-hashing dependency with
  `@node-rs/argon2` (pure Rust via napi-rs). `argon2` had caused two
  separate deployment failures on two different platforms (an
  Alpine/musl prebuild issue, and a still-unexplained SIGSEGV
  crash-loop on GitHub's `ubuntu-latest` CI runners — see `CLAUDE.md`
  for the full, ultimately-inconclusive investigation); the replacement
  ships prebuilt binaries for every platform this project targets and
  never falls back to compiling from source. Existing stored password
  hashes remain verifiable — both libraries use the same standard PHC
  string format, confirmed by directly cross-verifying a real hash
  between the two before switching. No action needed on upgrade, no
  password resets.

## [0.1.2]

**Upgrade from v0.1.1 as soon as practical.** Two bugs in that release
are severe enough on their own to justify this one:

- **Any account with 2FA enabled was permanently locked out of login**,
  with no way back in — not even via a recovery code. The login
  response's 2FA-pending branch never set the CSRF cookie `totp/verify`
  requires, so every `totp/verify` call (including recovery-code
  attempts) 403'd with "CSRF token mismatch," unconditionally, for
  every account. **If you're running v0.1.1 and have 2FA enabled on
  any staff account, upgrade before enrolling further users** — those
  accounts have been unable to log in since enabling it, and existing
  locked-out accounts will need a staff admin to disable 2FA for them
  (`POST /auth/totp/disable`, or directly via the database) after
  upgrading, since the fix doesn't retroactively unlock an in-progress
  login attempt.
- **A genuinely fresh install failed immediately** on the exact command
  the docs tell you to run. Every `deploy/native/*.sh` script an admin
  runs directly was git-tracked without the executable bit; `sudo
  ./install-native.sh` right after `git clone` died at "Permission
  denied" trying to exec `setup-database.sh`. Anyone who successfully
  installed v0.1.1 did so from a checkout that had picked up a local,
  uncommitted `chmod +x` somewhere along the way (e.g. copying files
  instead of cloning) — a literal fresh clone was never viable.

### Fixed

- The 2FA lockout above also had a second, independent bug: the
  code-verification schema only accepted 6 digits, rejecting every
  recovery code's `XXXXX-XXXXX` format before it reached the
  already-correct recovery-code check. Both fixed together; verified
  live end-to-end (enroll, login-requires-code, wrong code rejected,
  recovery code works once and is rejected on reuse).
- Company config had no way to set `companyGstin`/`gstStateCode` after
  the initial seed, despite the frozen booking service already reading
  `gstStateCode` to decide CGST+SGST vs IGST. Added, with GSTIN format
  validation (checksum digit deferred — see `docs/todo.md`) and a
  Company Config UI section.
- Health endpoint's `version` field was hardcoded `0.1.0` in every real
  deployment (`npm_package_version` is only set by `pnpm run`, never by
  systemd's/Docker's direct `node dist/main.js`). Now reads
  `package.json` directly.
- 18 of 19 generic master types (unit types, inquiry sources, charge
  types, etc.) 500'd on any create/update call that included a
  description — `createMasterSchema`'s optional `description` field is
  only backed by a real column on `PaymentPlanTemplate`; the shared
  factory blindly spread the whole dto into Prisma's `data`. Fixed once,
  at the root, in the factory.
- `DocumentType`, `InterestRule`, and `TransferFeeRule` couldn't be
  created via the API at all — each has its own required, non-nullable
  columns (`entityType`; `rateType`/`ratePercent`/`frequency`;
  `feeType`) that the generic master schema never had, so every attempt
  500'd on a Prisma "Argument missing" error instead of failing
  validation cleanly. The shared factory now supports a per-model
  `extraFields` schema extension.
- `LetterTemplate` had no working create path at all — zero templates
  could ever exist, blocking demand/allotment/reminder letter generation
  entirely. It was routed through the generic master factory (whose
  schema has no `subject`/`entityType`/`body`) instead of a dedicated
  module; given one, mirroring the existing `SmsTemplateModule`
  precedent, with merge-field validation at save time.
- Duplicate master names (any of the 18+ shared-factory types) returned
  a raw 500 instead of a clean "already exists" 400 — nothing in this
  codebase had ever caught Prisma's P2002 unique-constraint error for
  these dynamically-keyed services (unlike `RolesService`/`UsersService`,
  which pre-check via `findFirst`). Mapped once, in the factory.
- `install-native.sh`/`upgrade-native.sh`'s database migration step
  failed on any host where the git checkout lives under a directory
  tree the `postgres` OS user can't traverse (e.g. GitHub Actions
  runners: `/home/runner` is mode `0750`) — Prisma 6.19+ auto-discovers
  a `prisma.config.*` file in the current working directory before
  running any command, and that lookup's `lstat()` fails `EACCES` (not
  `ENOENT`) in that case, which Prisma treats as a hard failure rather
  than "no config file, proceed." `run_as_superuser()` now runs from
  the already-world-traversable release directory instead of the
  checkout.
- `install-native.sh`'s final `systemctl reload nginx` failed outright
  ("nginx.service is not active, cannot reload") on any host where apt
  installed nginx without starting it — the script only ever checked
  that the `nginx` binary was present, never that the service was
  running. Now `enable`s and `reload-or-restart`s it, correct whether
  nginx was already running or not.
- `CustomFieldDefinition.defaultValue` — accepted by the create/update
  schema since it was written, but no backing column ever existed, so
  any real caller sending it 500'd. Added the missing column.
- `POST /users` never returned the `phone` it had just saved — a
  `select` allowlist copy/paste gap (present in `update()`, missing
  from `create()`) left an admin with no way to confirm the phone
  number was stored.

Everything above except the two headline bugs was found by a full
production-readiness pass and a new through-the-wire creation test for
every master type and admin-creatable entity (users, roles, custom
fields) — the existing suite seeded rows directly, which is exactly why
these bugs survived to a tagged release. Also added: real-HTTP creation
coverage for all 22 master types plus users/roles/custom fields, and a
`native-install` CI job that runs the full native install on a real
`ubuntu-latest` runner on every push. That CI job is not yet green — a
separate, CI-runner-specific issue (the deployed app crash-looping with
SIGSEGV, isolated to argon2's native module, confirmed not to reproduce
on a real server) is still open and tracked in `CLAUDE.md`; it does not
affect real installs, only that one job's own coverage.

## [0.1.1]

### Added

- **Native install path** (`deploy/native/`): `install-native.sh` sets up
  OpenEstate as a systemd service behind nginx, talking to a PostgreSQL
  and Redis you already run — no Docker involved in production. Also
  ships `setup-database.sh` (standalone DB/role setup for a DBA-managed
  Postgres), `upgrade-native.sh` (backup → build → migrate → cutover,
  with automatic rollback on a failed healthcheck), `backup-native.sh` /
  `restore-native.sh`, and `uninstall.sh`. Docker Compose is unaffected
  and still fully supported — it's now positioned as a contributor tool
  for the test suite rather than the primary production path; see
  `docs/docs/installation.md` and `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
- A CI job (`native-install` in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs the full
  native install on a real `ubuntu-latest` runner — installs PostgreSQL,
  Redis, Node 20, nginx, and a build toolchain, runs `install-native.sh`,
  and asserts the health endpoint responds and a login succeeds over real
  HTTP — so the native path is verified on every push, not just once by
  hand.
- Consistent, user-visible toasts on failed mutations across both
  `apps/web` and `apps/portal` (`lib/toast.tsx` + a `MutationCache`-based
  global handler in each app's `main.tsx`), replacing a mix of silent
  failures, inline-only banners, and unhandled promise rejections found
  during an audit of ~15+ call sites.

### Fixed

- **Login failed on every fresh Docker Compose install with "Cannot POST
  /api/api/v1/auth/login".** `VITE_API_URL` defaulted to `/api`
  (`deploy/.env.example`, `deploy/docker-compose.yml`,
  `deploy/docker/{web,portal}.Dockerfile`), but `apps/web`/`apps/portal`'s
  own API client already hardcodes `/api/v1/...` on top of it, and
  nginx's `/api/` location already forwards that prefix through unchanged
  — doubling it. Since Vite bakes this value into the built JS bundle at
  image-build time, existing installs need `git pull` +
  `docker compose up -d --build` (not just a restart) to pick up the fix.
- **Every validation error (400) showed the generic toast "Validation
  failed" instead of saying what was actually wrong**, across both apps
  — nestjs-zod's default exception hardcodes that message regardless of
  which field failed. The API now returns the real per-field reason
  (e.g. `"url: Invalid url; secret: String must contain at least 16
  character(s)"`).
- A handful of mutations (webhook endpoint creation in `apps/web`, three
  non-mutation-hook webhook actions, PDF downloads in both apps) failed
  silently or inline-only, with no toast — fixed as part of the same
  audit.
- Eight real bugs in the native-install scripts, found only by running
  `install-native.sh` end-to-end on a genuinely clean VM — none caught by
  shellcheck, `nginx -t`, or a careful read of the scripts: a missing
  build-toolchain prerequisite check (`argon2` needs `make`/`g++`/
  `python3`); a build failure silently swallowed by a `set -e`
  propagation gap; `NODE_ENV=production` leaking into the build and
  dropping devDependencies; the build's own stdout corrupting a command
  substitution; `node <script>` failing on pnpm's shell-script `.bin`
  shims; a fragile cross-store Prisma client copy replaced with
  regenerating the client in place; `backup-native.sh` failing under RLS
  by dumping via the wrong role; and `restore-native.sh` failing to drop
  a database still held open by the running service. Full detail in
  `CLAUDE.md`'s decisions log.

### Verified

- Ubuntu 24.04 LTS with PostgreSQL 16, and Ubuntu 25.10 with PostgreSQL
  17 — both confirmed end-to-end: fresh install, safe re-install, real
  HTTP login and role creation, upgrade with rollback, backup/restore,
  and both uninstall modes. The scripts check for `psql` presence, not
  an exact major version, so this isn't expected to be an exhaustive
  platform list — just what's actually been run.

## [0.1.0] — first tagged release

The first tagged release of OpenEstate: a self-hostable, open-source
(AGPL-3.0) CRM for real estate, built for the Indian market first with a
plugin system designed for other verticals to adapt it without forking
core code.

### Core domain

- **Pre-sales**: inquiry capture and dedup, round-robin/manual lead
  assignment (fair under concurrency, advisory-lock serialized), follow-up
  and site-visit tracking, escalation on overdue follow-ups, applicant
  merge with a consent audit ledger, funnel/ageing/source reports.
- **Post-sales / financial core**: append-only ledger (balances are always
  computed, never stored), booking → payment plan → receipt → cheque
  lifecycle, GST (CGST/SGST/IGST) and TDS (194-IA) handling, interest
  accrual, unit transfer, cancellation with configurable deduction rules,
  two-phase refunds, gap-free receipt/booking numbering, PDF generation
  (receipts, statements, demand/allotment/reminder letters) with dispatch
  and delivery tracking. Correctness proven by a property-based test suite
  (fast-check) run against every CI build.
- **Brokers and commissions**: slab-based commission rules, accrual with
  point-in-time snapshotting, a request → approve → pay → reject payment
  workflow, TDS (194-H) withholding, and clawback on booking cancellation.
- **Customer and broker portals**: separate, minimal-scope authentication
  and rate-limit buckets from staff; row-level security is the primary
  isolation mechanism for these untrusted clients, not just a
  defense-in-depth backstop.
- **Custom fields, terminology, and module flags**: every entity supports
  admin-defined custom fields; labels ("Unit" → "Product", etc.) and
  enabled modules are configurable per company, not hard-coded — the
  mechanism the `generic-sales` plugin (below) proves out for a
  non-real-estate vertical.

### Plugins, webhooks, and integrations

- A plugin SDK (`@openestate/plugin-sdk`) with capability-gated context
  access, package-boundary isolation (no database access path from
  plugin code at all), SSRF-hardened outbound HTTP, and a first-party
  `generic-sales` reference plugin.
- Outbound webhooks: HMAC-signed, replay-protected, retried with
  exponential backoff, auto-disabled after sustained failure.
- Inbound lead API: per-key authentication and rate limits, a
  generic field-mapping config so common vendor integrations (99acres,
  MagicBricks, a generic webhook) need zero plugin code.

### Security

- RBAC permission guards **and** independent Postgres row-level security
  on every tenant-scoped table — not RLS as an afterthought.
- Argon2id password hashing, TOTP 2FA, rotating refresh tokens with
  reuse-family revocation, account lockout with exponential backoff.
- PAN encryption at rest (AES-256-GCM, per-domain keys, never reused
  across PAN/TOTP/plugin-secret rotation domains) for both brokers and
  applicants; phone/PAN masking in list views and logs.
- Immutable financial ledger enforced at the database level (a trigger
  blocks UPDATE/DELETE, not just application discipline).
- Redis-backed rate limiting shared across replicas and surviving
  restarts.
- Docker images pinned to verified sha256 digests; a randomly generated,
  single-use initial admin credential (never a shared default).
- A formal [OWASP ASVS L2 self-assessment](docs/docs/security/asvs-checklist.md)
  and [STRIDE threat model](docs/docs/security/threat-model.md) per
  module, stating accepted residual risk plainly rather than implying
  guarantees the architecture doesn't make.

### Known limitations (see `docs/todo.md` for the full list)

- Rate-limit storage is now Redis-backed, but no other component of the
  first-party plugin trust model provides worker-thread/process
  isolation against a deliberately malicious plugin — first-party
  plugins ship as reviewed npm workspace packages in this repository,
  the same review bar as any other module, not as untrusted third-party
  code.
- No automated TLS/certificate setup in `install.sh` — self-hosters
  bring their own reverse-proxy TLS termination.
- Some staff-service call sites still self-wrap tenant context
  redundantly with the ambient interceptor (low-risk cleanup, a runtime
  guardrail already backstops the one bug class this pattern caused
  historically).
