/**
 * Refuses an access token (staff or portal, including a 2FA-pending one) whose
 * `av` no longer equals the user's current authorisation version: the user was
 * deactivated, their role or its permissions changed, their password was
 * changed or reset, or their 2FA was reset since the token was issued. Without
 * this, such a token kept working until it expired (up to 15 minutes), because
 * the JWT check never looks at the database.
 *
 * A token with no `av` (issued before this check existed) is refused the same
 * way. The answer is 401, so the browser tries its refresh token: a session that
 * is still allowed gets a fresh token and carries on; one that is not (deactivated,
 * password changed elsewhere) lands on the sign-in page.
 *
 * Global, registered straight after TwoFactorPendingGuard. @Public routes have
 * no req.user and are untouched. Never fails open: if neither Redis nor the
 * database can be read, AuthzVersionService throws and the request fails.
