/**
 * v0.8.4: plain messages for the three foreign keys restored as ON DELETE
 * RESTRICT (migration 20261022000000_restore_foreign_keys). Without this a
 * refused delete surfaces as a raw 500.
 *
 * Lives here, not in PaymentPlanService or the masters factory, so the
 * frozen financial services are unchanged: they still let the database
 * refuse, and this turns that refusal into a 409. Every other error,
 * including every other foreign key violation, goes to Nest's default
 * handling exactly as before.
 *
 * Matches on Prisma's P2003 code by shape rather than `instanceof`: the API
 * and @openestate/db can load separate copies of the Prisma runtime, and an
 * instanceof check across them silently never matches.
