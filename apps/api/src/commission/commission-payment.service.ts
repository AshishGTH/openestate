/**
 * REQUESTED -> APPROVED -> PAID | REJECTED, mirroring RefundStatus's shape
 * (apps/api/src/postsales/refund.service.ts, frozen — used only as a
 * design template, never imported). Ledger entries post ONLY at pay() —
 * deliberately unlike RefundService (which posts its ledger entry at
 * approve() and only records a PaymentVoucher at pay()) — because a
 * refund's obligation is newly-recognized at approval, while a broker's
 * commission was already accrued earlier (CommissionService.accrueForBooking).
 * request()/approve() here are pure dispute/authorization sign-off with no
 * ledger effect; the ledger only moves when cash actually leaves at pay(),
 * which is also the only point TDS is computed and withheld.
 *
 * TDS-194H asymmetry with 194-IA (ReceiptService, frozen, not touched):
 * for 194-IA the COMPANY IS THE DEDUCTEE — a buyer withholds tax FROM the
 * company, so the company is owed a certificate (Form 16B) before it can
 * claim credit, hence ReceiptService posts a TDS_RECEIVABLE that stays
 * outstanding until a TdsCertificate zeroes it via TDS_CERT_ADJUSTMENT.
 * For 194-H the COMPANY IS THE DEDUCTOR — it withholds tax FROM THE
 * BROKER and later files its own TDS return and issues Form 16A TO the
 * broker; from the broker's ledger (what CommissionLedgerEntry tracks),
 * there is nothing to receive or certify. The moment pay() runs, gross
 * minus TDS is a completed, known fact — TDS_WITHHELD is final, not a
 * receivable. See CLAUDE.md's Phase 5 Decisions log for the same
 * paragraph, cross-referenced from the 194-IA side too.

   * first (same idea as the receipt-entry UI's oldest-dues-first
   * allocation), then TDS is computed ONCE on the total gross and split
   * proportionally across those per-booking allocations via `allocate`
   * (largest-remainder — no last-paise loss), so each affected booking
   * gets its own PAYMENT + TDS_WITHHELD pair. This is what makes
   * handleBookingCancelled's PER-BOOKING outstanding calculation correct
   * for a broker paid across multiple bookings in one CommissionPayment.
