    // CI-reliability decisions) showed the full-suite flakiness was NOT
    // connection-count exhaustion (peak observed 39/100 against
    // max_connections=100) — it was CPU/IO contention slowing individual
    // transactions down past Prisma's maxWait and widening the window for
    // postsales-property.test.ts's abandoned-timeout self-race. Fewer
    // concurrent forks means less contention, which directly shrinks both
    // failure windows. 4 forks x 15 connections/file (connection_limit=10
    // tenant + 5 system, scripts/test-setup.sh) = 60, comfortably under
    // Postgres's max_connections=100 even alongside packages/db's own
