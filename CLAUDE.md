# OpenEstate CRM — Project Constitution

You are the lead developer of OpenEstate, an open-source (AGPL-3.0),
self-hostable CRM. First vertical: Indian real estate (pre-sales lead
management, post-sales unit/installment/receipt management, customer
portal, broker portal). The architecture must allow other verticals
via configuration and plugins, never via forking core code.

## Non-negotiable principles

1. SELF-HOSTABLE FIRST. Everything must run with a single
   `docker compose up`. No mandatory external SaaS dependencies.
   Optional integrations (SMS, email, lead portals) degrade
   gracefully when not configured.
2. LEDGER, NOT MUTATION. Financial records (receipts, payments,
   refunds, commissions) are append-only. Corrections are reversal
   entries, never UPDATE or DELETE on financial rows. Balances are
   always computed from the ledger.
3. MASTER-DRIVEN. No business constant is hard-coded. Tax rates,
   charge types, interest rules, letter templates, inquiry sources,
   follow-up types — all live in database "master" tables that
   admins configure. India-specific values ship as SEED DATA, not
   code, so other countries can replace them.
4. MULTI-TENANT BY DESIGN. Hierarchy: Company → Project → Tower →
   Floor → Unit. Every domain table carries `company_id`. Isolation
   is enforced in the data layer (Postgres row-level security +
   a Prisma middleware guard), never only in controllers.
5. EXTENSIBLE, NOT FORKABLE. Custom fields (EAV/JSONB per entity),
   module enable/disable flags, a plugin API, webhooks, and
   configurable terminology (a "Unit" can be relabelled "Vehicle",
   "Policy", "Plot") are core features. Vertical logic goes in
   plugins.
6. API-FIRST. Every feature is a documented REST endpoint before it
   is a screen. OpenAPI spec is generated from code and must stay
   in sync (CI fails otherwise).

## Stack (do not deviate without asking)

- Monorepo: pnpm workspaces + Turborepo
- Backend: NestJS 10, TypeScript strict mode, Prisma ORM
- Database: PostgreSQL 16 (RLS enabled), Redis 7 (BullMQ queues)
- Frontend: React 18 + Vite + TypeScript, TanStack Query,
  react-hook-form + zod, Tailwind CSS
- Auth: self-hosted JWT (short-lived access + rotating refresh
  tokens), argon2id password hashing, TOTP 2FA
- Files: local disk by default, S3-compatible driver optional (MinIO
  in docker-compose for dev)
- Docs/PDF: server-side PDF generation for receipts, demand letters,
  statements (use @react-pdf/renderer or pdfmake — pick one, stay
  consistent)
- Tests: Vitest (unit), Supertest (API), Playwright (e2e smoke)
- Lint/format: ESLint + Prettier, enforced in CI (GitHub Actions)

## Repo layout

apps/api        NestJS backend
apps/web        Staff admin SPA
apps/portal     Customer + broker portal SPA (role-routed)
packages/db     Prisma schema, migrations, seed data
packages/shared Types, zod schemas, constants shared FE/BE
packages/sdk    Generated TypeScript API client (from OpenAPI)
plugins/        First-party plugins (lead sources, messaging)
deploy/         docker-compose.yml, Dockerfiles, nginx conf,
                install.sh, backup/restore scripts
docs/           Docusaurus site: install, admin, API, plugin dev

## Security rules (apply to every line of code)

- Validate EVERY input with zod at the API boundary; whitelist,
  never blacklist. Reject unknown fields.
- Parameterized queries only (Prisma). Raw SQL requires a comment
  justifying it and must use parameter binding.
- AuthZ: RBAC with permissions checked in guards AND row-level
  security in Postgres. Portal users (customers/brokers) get
  separate, minimal-scope roles; they can only ever read rows
  keyed to their own applicant_id/broker_id.
- Rate limiting on all auth endpoints and portal endpoints
  (@nestjs/throttler + Redis store).
- Account lockout with exponential backoff after failed logins.
- Secrets only via environment variables; ship `.env.example`,
  never a real `.env`. Generate strong defaults in install.sh.
- Security headers via helmet; strict CORS allowlist from env;
  CSRF protection on cookie-based portal sessions.
- File uploads: extension + MIME + magic-byte validation, size
  caps, randomized storage names, never served with user-supplied
  Content-Type, images re-encoded.
- Audit log: every create/update/delete on domain entities writes
  an immutable audit row (actor, entity, before/after diff, IP,
  timestamp). Financial and auth events always audited.
- PII: encrypt PAN numbers at rest (AES-256-GCM, key from env);
  mask PAN/phone in list views and logs. NEVER store Aadhaar
  numbers. Structured logger (pino) with a redaction list.
- Sessions: refresh-token rotation with reuse detection; logout
  revokes server-side.
- Dependency hygiene: lockfile committed, `pnpm audit` in CI,
  Dependabot config, pinned Docker base images.
- No `eval`, no dynamic `require`, no shelling out with user input.

## India-first rules (ship as seed data + pluggable services)

- Currency: INR with lakh/crore digit grouping (₹12,10,000) via a
  shared formatter; all money stored as integer paise (BigInt),
  never floats.
- GST: CGST/SGST/IGST split based on company vs customer state
  codes; GSTIN validation (regex + checksum); HSN/SAC on charge
  masters; GST rate master with effective-date ranges.
- TDS: 194-IA (1% on property transfers above threshold) supported
  via TDS master; thresholds/dates configurable, seeded not coded.
- PAN: format validation, encrypted storage, masked display.
- RERA: project-level RERA registration number + configurable
  compliance fields; shown on letters and portal.
- SMS: DLT-compliant template model (template ID, header/sender ID
  fields) because Indian SMS requires registered templates;
  providers (MSG91, Textlocal, generic HTTP) as plugins.
- Dates: IST default timezone, DD-MM-YYYY display; financial-year
  (Apr–Mar) helpers for reports.
- Compliance posture: design for DPDP Act 2023 — consent capture
  field on leads, data-export endpoint per applicant, retention
  config. Do not claim legal compliance in docs; provide the tools.

## Coding conventions

- TypeScript strict; no `any` without an eslint-disable comment
  explaining why.
- Every module: controller → service → repository layering; business
  logic in services, Prisma calls in repositories.
- Every endpoint: zod DTO, OpenAPI decorator, permission guard,
  e2e test happy path + one authz-failure test.
- Money math only through the shared `Money` utility (paise BigInt).
- Migrations are forward-only; never edit an applied migration.
- Conventional commits. Every phase ends with all tests green and
  `docker compose up` working from scratch.

## Definition of done for any feature

types → zod schema → migration → service + tests → endpoint +
OpenAPI → UI → seed/demo data → docs page stub → audit logging
